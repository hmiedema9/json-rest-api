#### REST API in Go JSON
This is currently a work in progress and a learning project. This will eventually become a fully working REST API template written in GoLang with authentication.

_NOTE:_ This repo isn't functioning in its current state. I will be updating it soon, but have gotten busy with a few other things in life. Thank you for the recent stars and support, and I will give this project more attention in the coming weeks.
